# Schema versioning

GraphQL Editor lets you deploy multiple versions of your schema. Controlling the process of versioning makes keeping your backend consistent and up-to-date much easier. After the version is deployed the schema and the graph inside become read-only.

To deploy a new version from the schema, open the version menu, and select **Deploy a new version**.

To open a version, open the versions menu and select the desired version.
