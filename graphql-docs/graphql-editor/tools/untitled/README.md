## GraphQL Editor CLI

Make your GraphQL schema your one and only source of truth by translating it to literally anything. The main goal is to provide an interactive experience creating GraphQL as a service. Our CLI is compatible with GraphQL editor projects (both free and paid tiers).

### Installation

#### Global

```
npm i -g graphql-editor-cli
```

#### Inside Repo

```
npm i -D graphql-editor-cli
```

then use with (for example) npx or as a `package.json` script

### Usage

All commands work in 3 ways:

* you can provide all arguments with flags
* you can get the arguments from a local config file
* you can complete the arguments in interactive modes
