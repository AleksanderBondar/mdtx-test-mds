# Code Editor

Our code editor for microservices is based on `monaco-editor` with some extra typings support from our typings service. Typings are fetched automagically when they are added inside `package.json`

### Bootstrapped project

By default, the code is bootstrapped. It allows you to start coding custom resolvers much faster. Standard microservice environments consist of `package.json` `tsconfig.json` `src` folder and generated typings for the project.
