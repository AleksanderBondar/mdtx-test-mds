# Secrets & CORS

### Secrets

You can safely store secrets inside the GraphQL Editor Cloud. To do so, navigate to microservices (CTRL+K, C, M) then Settings (CTRL+K, S) and add & edit secrets there.

### CORS

You can also add allowed origins in the CORS menu inside Settings in the same way as secrets
