# Resolvers

Build resolvers with GraphQL Editor Integrations and Code.&#x20;



### Building resolvers for GraphQL fields

To build a resolver you can use one of the following options:

* no resolver (usual for scalar types)
* custom resolver, which you can create yourself using the code editor
* one of our built-in integrations

Selecting custom resolver will require you to put the correct path to generated TypeScript code or JavaScript code of the resolver.
