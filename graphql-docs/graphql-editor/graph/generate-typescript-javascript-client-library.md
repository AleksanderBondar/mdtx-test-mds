# Generate TypeScript library

GraphQL Editor offers an easy way to generate autocomplete JS/TS clients for Browser/Node/React Native. Working with a generated client provides an easy and **type-safe** way for developers to work with their schema. To generate an autocomplete library your schema should  at least have a **root schema Query type.**

To generate a GraphQL Client:
