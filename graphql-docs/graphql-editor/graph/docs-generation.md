# Markdown Docs

### Browsing the docs

All descriptions inside a schema are rendered with a remark markdown engine. After clicking a type inside the Table of Contents the interface should scroll down to that field in the schema. If you click on the type inside a field in the schema it will also navigate you to the page containing the documentation of the clicked type.

### Editing docs

To edit any field in the docs, click the pencil icon appearing on hover over an element.
