# Deploy

Inspired by frontend deployment platforms we have focused on creating an easy experience. To deploy your backend code to our shared workers you need call:\


```
npx graphql-editor-cli deploy
```

It will trigger the deployment to serverless GraphQL functions and additionally provide logs for this deployment.
