# Cloud API Platform | online GraphQL playground

### API Platform

The API platform is a tree-based GraphQL query builder. It lets you build queries with just a few simple clicks and input data in easy to navigate user-friendly forms. You can collaborate on all of that LIVE with your team. If you prefer the old way of working just use our **GraphiQL Cloud**.

### Instant Mock Backend

Deploy it in seconds, with just a couple clicks. The mock backend allows you to query your GraphQL Schema and get type-safe responses. If that is not enough you can also configure the method and values for response mocking.

### E2E Tests Builder

Writing tests is a long and boring process, that's why our builder gives you access to click-out E2E tests for your GraphQL backend.

### REST to GraphQL

Still using a REST API? Good because you can use our click-out proxy as a fast and easy way to connect it to your GraphQL project.

Remember. Your schema has to have a root query for GraphQL backends to work
