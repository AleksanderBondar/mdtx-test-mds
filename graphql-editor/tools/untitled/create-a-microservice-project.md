# Create a microservice project | GraphQL CLI

```
npx graphql-editor-cli create backend
```

The above command will ask you interactively for your namespace and project inside GraphQL Editor. After that, it will create a project in a folder with the project name. It will also attach:

* stucco backend
* schema
* typings for resolvers
* package.json
* eslint
* prettier

This will let you jumpstart your backend project.&#x20;
