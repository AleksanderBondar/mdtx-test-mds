What is better than a plain old API? An interactive, visual one, that you can work on easily from your browser. With the new GraphQL Editor, this is now possible for every developer!

### Keep your schema in the cloud.

Your GraphQL schema is available in the cloud for all your team members. You can play with a fake backend and attach GraphiQL or bind it to the real one.

### Build using blocks

Keep building your schema while being type-safe at the same time! Use our visual editor to create your schema in a much faster and cleaner way.

### Deploy&#x20;

Deploy microservices in TypeScript/Javascript to our GraphQL Editor Shared cloud.

### Document

Automatically generate markdown HTML documentation for your schema.
